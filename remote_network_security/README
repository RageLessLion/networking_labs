Port forwarding:

->NAT is used to allow stations with private ip addresses from a local network to access the internet . NAT can also be used
to allow a station from the local network to be accessed from the internet (this process is called port forwarding)

For example :

If we want to access a station through SSH from the internet is not possible directly because that station has an private IP address.
The solution is opening a port on the gateway and redirecting this port (port forwarding) toward the SSH service on the specic station.



The following command needs to be inserted on the router (gateway):

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.2:80

what it does? --->It redirects all the traffic that comes from the port 8080 on the router to the port 80 on the desired station .
