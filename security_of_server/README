1.SSH

-> ssh-keygen -t rsa : generating public/private key pairs
-> ssh-copy-id user@remote_machine_ip : copy the public key to allow connections on another machine

! if ssh-copy-id does not work you can try to copy the public key of the machine you are on in the file .ssh/authorized_keys on the
machine you are trying to connect to

------

2.SCP

scp (Secure Copy Protocol) is a command-line utility used for securely transferring files between a local machine and a remote server, or between two remote servers.
It leverages the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol to encrypt the data transfer, ensuring security.


Usage of commands:

A)From local to remote:

->for files:
scp file.txt user@remote_host:/path/to/destination/

->for directories:
scp -r /local/directory user@remote_host:/path/to/destination

B)From remote to local:

->for files:
scp user@remote_host:/path/to/remote_file /local/destination(copying a file from remote to local)

->for directories :
scp -r user@remote_host:/remote/directory /local/destination

------

3.Copying files using different protocols(analyzing timeframe and consumption of resources)

FTP:
time curl -T file-100M.dat -u student:student ftp://host/file-100M-ftp.dat


SSH:
time scp file-100M.dat student@host:file-100M-scp.dat

SSH takes longer due to the time required for encryption
