Disclaimer : I am including only data that has been relevant or is relevant at the moment the the tools / attacks i am using.

Interface Modes -> 

-----

Managed Mode (used for normal operation to connect to networks) :

When we want our interface to act as a clint or a station . In this mode our card will search for AP's .
It can be considered default mode . 

command used : sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed  

Then to connect to a network : sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid name_of_network

------

Monitor Mode(passive network monitoring and packet analysis):

->can capture data from multiple networks without having to connect to them regardless of it's intented recipient. 


------


Master Mode (also reffered to as AP mode)

->used to turn a wireless device into an AP that other devices can connect to.

->used for evil twin attack (pretty self explanatory)


Introduction to Aircrack-ng


Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

    Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
    Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
    Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
    Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).


1)airmon-ng ->can be useed to enable monitor mode 
2)airodump-ng -> tool for capturing packets (especially raw 802.11 frames + primary function : collecting WEP IV or WPA/WPA2 handshakes)


BSSID-> shows the mac address of AP's

PWR->shows the power of the network

#Data->shows the number of captured data packets

STATION->mac address of the client connected to the network
