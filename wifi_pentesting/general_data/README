Disclaimer : I am including only data that has been relevant or is relevant at the moment the the tools / attacks i am using.

Interface Modes -> 

-----

Managed Mode (used for normal operation to connect to networks) :

When we want our interface to act as a clint or a station . In this mode our card will search for AP's .
It can be considered default mode . 

command used : sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed  

Then to connect to a network : sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid name_of_network

------

Monitor Mode(passive network monitoring and packet analysis):

->can capture data from multiple networks without having to connect to them regardless of it's intented recipient. 


------


Master Mode (also reffered to as AP mode)

->used to turn a wireless device into an AP that other devices can connect to.

->used for evil twin attack (pretty self explanatory)


Introduction to Aircrack-ng


Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

    Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
    Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
    Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
    Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).


1)airmon-ng ->can be useed to enable monitor mode 
2)airodump-ng -> tool for capturing packets (especially raw 802.11 frames + primary function : collecting WEP IV or WPA/WPA2 handshakes)

airodump-ng wlan0mon -w file_by_airodump (command used for airgraph)



3)airgraph-ng : python script designed  for generating graphical representation of wireless networks usiong CSV files produced by
Airodump-ng

command used : sudo airgraph-ng -i file_by_airodump.csv -g CAPR -o graph_image.png

The AP's are color-based on their encryption type:

GREEN for WPA
YELLOW for WEP
RED for open networks
Black for unknown encryption


4)aireplay-ng : used o generate traffic for aircrack-ng for cracking WEP and WPA-PSK keys.
These are attacks that can cause deauth for the purpose of capturing WPA handshake , fake auth
hand crafted ARP request injection and ARP request reinjection .


What is Packet Injection?
R: ability of wireless interface to create or transmit custom packets directly onto the wireless network(crafted manually rather then being created by the normal stack)

Packet injection is crucial for a possible deauth attack -> attacker forges 802.11 deauth frames.

5)aircrack-ng : Aircrack-ng is a powerful tool designed for network security testing, capable of cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 networks that use pre-shared keys or PMKID. Aircrack-ng is an offline attack tool, as it works with captured packets and doesn't need direct interaction with any Wi-Fi device.
